        <!-- Project 1: LinkedIn Social Media Plan -->
        <section id="project1">
            <h2>Project 1: LinkedIn Social Media Plan</h2>
            <p>Developed a social media content schedule for Mizzou business alumni group with more than a thousand members to increase engagement. This project involved creating graphics, providing thought-provoking articles, and business-centered polls.</p>
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>This project highlighted the importance of social media planning. I learned how to effectively integrate various engagement tools to create a cohesive stream of content. If I were to redo this project, I would incorporate more alumni feedback during the development phase.</p>

        <!-- Project 2: Transcribed Podcasts into eBooks -->
        <section id="project2">
            <h2>Project 2: Transcribed Podcasts into eBooks</h2>
            <p>Created eBooks transcribed from popular podcast interviews done by the company’s CEO. The books included condensed, downloadable, and easy-to-read information from the podcasts for professionals to read on-the-go.</p>
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>This project taught me how to transcribe audio into a readable format along with how to write an eBook. I also learned how to write content for industry professionals, but if I did it again, I would’ve incorporated AI to make the writing more efficient.</p>

        <!-- Project 3: Concept Photoshoot Plans -->
        <section id="project3">
            <h2>Project 3: Concept Photoshoot Plans</h2>
            <p>Created and planned concept photoshoots for models’ portfolios. This would include finding locations, booking photographers, and organizing support teams.</p>
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>Developing these photoshoots emphasized the need for clear communication and proactive planning. I gained valuable insights into scheduling, organization, and connections within the industry. Thinking back, something I would’ve done differently was make stronger connections with the people I hired for shoots to keep those relationships.</p>
